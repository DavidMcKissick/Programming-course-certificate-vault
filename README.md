# What is this repository?
## This repository is the only official place to verify certificates achieved via the Twitch programming course series by VaguePancakery (David McKissick)

To view a list of every person who has earned a certificate through the program as well as which certificates they've earned, open "earned certifications.md"

To view an individual certificate, find that person's folder in "Students" then find the certificate you'd like to view.

### Why trust McKissick Programming Certifications
Unlike most low-level teacher certifications I take my certifications very seriously. All Certifications are earned through demonstration of skill and can be easily verified via the earned_certifications.md list.

As well as this, my certifications are completely free to obtain. I charge nothing for my classes or certification services. My certifications all contain a QR code to the student's file, a certificate number, and a URL to this repository for confirmation purposes. 

Beyond all else, I take forgery, fraud, and plagiarism extremely seriously. I vet each certification submission for these things to ensure that no one obtains a certification without authentically having the relevant skill to earn it.

If you are ever concerned about another's certification, feel free to contact me to discuss your concerns.
