# What is this repository?
## This repository is the only official place to verify certificates achieved via the Twitch programming course series by VaguePancakery (David McKissick)

To view a list of every person who has earned a certificate through the program as well as which certificates they've earned, open "earned certifications.md"

To view an individual certificate, find that persons folder in "Students" then find the certificate you'd like to view.
